Assumptions:
1. Load product information, like product name, product code, pack information and price. In real depolyment, these process can be done from database or by file input (pre-load). I implemented both ways in the program. 
However, the best way is to fetch the data from database as needed, i.e. "select * from product join packinfo where product_code = '<product code>' order by pack".
Database can run on the same server as the program (locally), or on remote/distributed servers from the program (remotely). When set to remote, access rules for the remote servers should allow the port of database.

2.Different types of input/output.
Program implemented the basic console application, the user interaction is happened in command line. However, it can be winforms or web.
The function ResponseToInput provides the interface to return the results based on two variables, product number and product code.
For a website, product number and product code can be obtained from a form and submit based on 'GET' or 'POST' request. C# has Razor to read the variables and can invoke the function to get the result and display it on the page.
